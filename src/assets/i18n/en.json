    "DESCRIPTION": "As an art form, architecture enters into the sphere of spiritual and material culture. Unlike utilitarian construction and aesthetic activities, such as design, architecture as an art solves artistic-figurative problems, that is, it expresses in artistic images a person's ideas about space and time and a person's place in the surrounding world."
